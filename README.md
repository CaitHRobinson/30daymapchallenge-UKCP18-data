## #30daymapchallenge using UKCP18 climate projections data

The map is based on Met Office [UKCP18 Climate Projections](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/ukcp18/science-reports/UKCP18-Overview-report.pdf). The data selected is the average July temperature (mean) at the surface using a RCP 8.5 scenario at a 2.2km resolution. I opted for the 01 climate model which is based on the Had GEM3-GC3.05 > r00lilp0000 > HadREM3-GA705 > HadREM3-RAIIM. Local projections are provided for three time periods: 1981-2000; 2021-2040; 2061-2080.

See Table C.1. in [accompanying documentation](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/ukcp/ukcp18-guidance-data-availability-access-and-formats.pdf) for information about file name conventions.
